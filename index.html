		<center><h2>About me</h2>
		
		      <center><p class="p1">Hello, I'm Jordan, originally from Sofia, Bulgaria. I hold a degree in game design from Bournemouth University, and I currently reside in the vibrant city of London, UK. </p>

 <p class="p1">My passion for game development ignited during high school when I enrolled in modeling classes, which primarily focused on architectural principles. However, I found myself deeply enamored with the creative process and knew I wanted to explore this passion further. With an existing love for gaming, I delved into the realm of Unreal Engine and it was at that moment I resolved to devote my career to crafting immersive experiences for individuals, not only within the gaming industry but also across various other forms of media.  </p>
